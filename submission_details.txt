SanDisk Hackathon
Track Name: AI/ML
Theme Name: Intelligent Storage Management
Problem Statement: 
Detailed Architecture/Block Diagram: ./guardiandrive/docs/architecture_diagram.png
Detailed Methodology: 
1. Drive Health Prediction: Uses XGBoost on SMART metrics to predict failure probability.
2. Access Pattern Analysis: Implements K-means clustering to classify data into Hot, Warm, Cold, and Archive tiers.
3. Intelligent Tiering: Rule-based + ML engine optimizes costs by moving data between local SSD/HDD and cloud storage (S3).
4. Compression Optimization: Calculates ROI for compression based on storage cost vs. compute cost.
5. Multi-Cloud Arbitrage: Real-time pricing comparison to select the most cost-effective cloud provider.

Deliverables Expected:
- Functional AI-driven storage dashboard.
- Predictive Maintenence Module.
- Automated Tiering Engine.
- API Documentation and Architecture Diagrams.
